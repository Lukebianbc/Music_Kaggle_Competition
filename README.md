#### Welcome to Kaggle competition "Classical Music Meets Classical Machine Learning".  The link to access the competition is https://www.kaggle.com/c/aipi520-spring2022/leaderboard. The objective in this competition is to predict which previous patrons of our customer, an orchestra, will purchase a season subscription to the upcoming 2014-15 concert season. There are different levels of subscription, but we are simply going to predict whether they will purchase a subscription (of any level) or not. The client has provided us a number of data files containing useful data on all previous patrons (see "Data" tab for details).
